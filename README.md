# Romantic Surprise Mobile Project

This project is a mobile website designed to create a romantic surprise experience. It features a simple interface that asks the user, "Você gostou do encontro?" with two response buttons: "Sim" and "Não." The design ensures that the "Não" button remains in a fixed position when clicked, enhancing user experience.
